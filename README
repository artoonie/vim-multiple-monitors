mainview-subview.vim: better support for vim on two monitors 
This fork allows you to run one vim view as your "main" vim,
and another session named EXPANDEDVIEW to show a full-screen view
of the current vim window.

Instructions
============

Start a number of vim servers and source the script:

$ vim <filename>
:source mainview-subview.vim
$ vim --servername EXPANDEDVIEW
:source mainview-subview.vim

When you move to a different vim window, that  file opens in the subview.
